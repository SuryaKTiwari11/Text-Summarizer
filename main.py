    Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that focuses on the interaction between humans and computers using natural language.
    The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of human language in a valuable way.
    Most NLP techniques rely on machine learning to extract meaning from human language.
    Applications of NLP are everywhere â€” in spam detection, sentiment analysis, language translation, chatbots, and more.
    Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved NLP capabilities.
