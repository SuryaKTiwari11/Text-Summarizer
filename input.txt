This file contains the input text for the text summarizer.

Instead of importing the whole nltk module, I simply imported the essential submodules (stopwords, word_tokenize, sent_tokenize, and FreqDist), which reduced unnecessary memory usage and improved efficiency.

To make the code cleaner and easier to read, I deleted self-explanatory comments.

NLTK includes a FreqDist class for calculating word frequencies. I used it directly on the list of words, eliminating the need to manually cycle through each word and update the frequency distribution.

To simplify the code, I used list comprehension instead of a standard for loop to calculate sentence scores and added randomness into the selection process of the top sentences.

Max Verstappen: The Dominant Force in Modern Formula 1

Max Verstappen, born on September 30, 1997, in Hasselt, Belgium, has emerged as one of the most formidable talents in Formula 1 history. The son of former F1 driver Jos Verstappen and competitive karter Sophie Kumpen, Max was practically born into motorsport. His racing journey began at an incredibly young age, with Max sitting in a go-kart for the first time at just four years old. By the time he was seven, he was already competing and dominating in karting championships across Belgium and the Netherlands.

Verstappen's path to Formula 1 was meteoric and unprecedented. He skipped Formula 2 entirely, making the leap directly from Formula 3 to F1 in 2015 with Toro Rosso (now AlphaTauri). At just 17 years and 166 days old, he became the youngest driver ever to compete in Formula 1, a record that led to the FIA subsequently introducing a minimum age requirement of 18 for future drivers. Despite his youth, Verstappen immediately impressed with his raw pace, overtaking abilities, and race craft that defied his limited experience.

In 2016, after just four races in his second season, Red Bull Racing made the bold decision to promote Verstappen to their senior team, replacing Daniil Kvyat. The gamble paid off spectacularly when Max won the Spanish Grand Prix on his Red Bull debut, becoming the youngest race winner in F1 history at 18 years and 228 days old. This victory announced his arrival as a genuine star of the sport and validated Red Bull's faith in his extraordinary talent.

Throughout his early years at Red Bull, Verstappen established himself as one of the grid's most exciting drivers. His aggressive overtaking maneuvers, commitment to finding the absolute limit, and fearless wheel-to-wheel racing became his trademarks. However, this period was also marked by occasional criticism of his driving style, with some competitors and pundits suggesting he was overly aggressive or reckless. Verstappen remained undeterred, maintaining that his approach was within the rules and necessary to compete against dominant Mercedes machinery.

The 2021 season marked a turning point in Verstappen's career. With Red Bull finally able to provide him with a car capable of consistently challenging Mercedes, Max engaged in one of the most intense championship battles in Formula 1 history against seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton. The season was characterized by incredible on-track battles, controversial incidents, and dramatic momentum swings. The championship culminated in an extraordinary and contentious final race in Abu Dhabi, where Verstappen overtook Hamilton on the last lap following a controversial safety car restart to claim his first World Championship.

Following his breakthrough championship, Verstappen has elevated his performances to new heights. The 2022 season saw him claim a record-breaking 15 victories en route to his second consecutive world title, dominated with remarkable consistency. In 2023, he reached unprecedented levels of dominance, winning 19 of 22 races and securing the championship with several races to spare. His driving style evolved from the raw aggression of his early years to incorporate calculated precision and exceptional race management, while still maintaining his trademark overtaking abilities.

By 2025, Verstappen has solidified his position as the benchmark in modern Formula 1. His exceptional car control, particularly in challenging conditions, has drawn comparisons to racing legends like Ayrton Senna and Michael Schumacher. His ability to extract the maximum performance from the car regardless of setup or conditions has become one of his greatest strengths. Additionally, his technical feedback and understanding of the car have made him an invaluable asset to Red Bull's development program.

Off the track, Verstappen is known for his straightforward, no-nonsense approach to media and public relations. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he shows little interest in building a brand beyond racing or engaging extensively on social media. He prefers to let his driving do the talking and spends much of his free time competing in virtual racing simulations, where he's also achieved considerable success. This dedication to racing in all forms speaks to his pure passion for competition.

Verstappen's relationship with Red Bull Racing has become one of the strongest driver-team partnerships in the sport. The organization has built its operation around him, creating an environment where his exceptional talents can flourish. Team Principal Christian Horner and technical genius Adrian Newey have repeatedly praised not just his driving ability but also his technical insight and feedback, which have contributed significantly to the team's continued success.

As Formula 1 heads toward major regulatory changes in the coming seasons, Verstappen's adaptability will be crucial to maintaining his position at the top of the sport. Throughout his career, he has demonstrated a remarkable ability to adjust his driving style to different regulations, car characteristics, and competitive situations. This adaptability, combined with his natural speed and racing instinct, suggests that regardless of how the technical regulations evolve, Max Verstappen will remain a formidable force in Formula 1 for years to come.

The statistics and records that Verstappen has accumulated by 2025 place him firmly among the all-time greats of Formula 1. Multiple world championships, dozens of race victories, pole positions, and fastest laps have established a legacy that extends far beyond being the sport's youngest-ever race winner. His impact on Formula 1 goes beyond statistics, however. Verstappen has inspired a new generation of drivers with his fearless approach and raw speed, while also helping to significantly grow the sport's popularity in the Netherlands and beyond.

Perhaps what sets Verstappen apart most from his contemporaries is his pure, unadulterated racing spirit. In an era of Formula 1 that has become increasingly technical, political, and commercial, Verstappen represents a throwback to the pure racer archetype. He races hard but fair, pushes himself and his equipment to the absolute limit, and approaches every competition with a winner's mentality. This spirit, combined with his exceptional talent, has earned him respect throughout the paddock, even from his fiercest rivals.

The Verstappen era of Formula 1 will be remembered not just for the statistics and championships, but for the way he has redefined what is possible behind the wheel of a Grand Prix car. His combination of raw speed, technical mastery, race craft, and mental fortitude has set new standards for what constitutes a complete Formula 1 driver. As the sport continues to evolve, Max Verstappen's place in its history is already secured as one of its most exceptional talents.
